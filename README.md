# BANKING-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-USING-MYSQL-WITH-FRONTEND
A banking management system using MySQL involves designing a database schema to store and manage information related to customers, accounts, transactions, and other banking operations. The MySQL database acts as the backend storage for this system, allowing data to be organized, queried, and updated efficiently.

Frontend development for such a system typically involves using HTML for structuring web pages and PHP for server-side scripting to interact with the MySQL database. XAMPP, a software package containing Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl, provides an integrated environment to develop and test these web applications locally on a computer.

HTML is used to create the user interface, displaying forms for data input (e.g., customer details, account transactions). PHP scripts handle the logic behind processing user requests, such as validating input, executing SQL queries to retrieve or update data in the MySQL database, and generating dynamic HTML content to display results to users.

For example, a user might fill out a form to transfer funds between accounts. The HTML form captures the necessary details (e.g., source account, destination account, amount), and when submitted, a PHP script validates the inputs and executes SQL queries to update the respective account balances in the MySQL database.

The connection between the frontend (HTML/PHP) and MySQL database is established using PHP's database connectivity functions (mysqli_connect() or PDO), allowing PHP scripts to communicate with the MySQL server to perform database operations.

Overall, the combination of MySQL for backend data storage and PHP with HTML for frontend development provides a robust framework for building and deploying banking management systems, enabling efficient data management and user interaction in a web-based environment.
